A music app with a audio visualizer that well, i just want to make for myself and for anyone interested.

The thought of this project came to me when i was minding my business and the app that i was using by default for music started doing stuff like forcing me to stay online or well ask for my permission to gather data so i will make this completely offline and i it will not gather any kind of data for i do not care of anyone's business.
